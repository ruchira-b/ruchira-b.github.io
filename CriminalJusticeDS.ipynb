    "Our study aimed to examine biases in the court system and criminal sentencing. Although our model had some errors, including outliers and skewed coefficients, we found [evidence](#graphs) suggesting that defendants of certain races tended to receive higher prison sentences, indicating a potential bias (See Figure 1). Similarly, certain citizenship statuses also corresponded to higher average prison times (See Figure 2). We also observed that the type of crime committed was a significant factor in determining prison time, which aligns with expectations (See figure 4). However, because our dataset was [biased](#bias), the results from our project [should not be used to make predictions](#takeaway) and should only be used to highlight biases in the system. "

    "The dataset being used is inherently biased due to the disparities concerning race, ethnicity, age, sex, citizenship, etc. that pervade the U.S. criminal justice system. Racial discrimination is the most noteworthy form of bias in our data; the distribution of total prison time for minority populations is much higher compared to the total prison time of Caucasians. Systematic racial discrimination permeates every stage of the United States criminal justice system including disproportionate policing in minority neighborhoods, unfair detainment prior to trial, and unequal parole surveillance. Because of thIS inherent bias, any conclusions made using this dataset will lead to unfair outcomes for individuals who belong to certain demographic groups which can also reinforce stereotypes in society that can lead to further discrimination and marginalization. Lastly, using this dataset to train our linear regression model will lead to the amplification of aforementioned biases and inaccurate predictions about which defendants are likely to re-offend or pose a danger to society, potentially resulting in unjustified restrictions on individuals' freedoms.\n",

In order to make our model stronger, we kept all potential explanatory variables in our regression such as race, citizenship status, and age, and had our dependent variable as prison time in months. We must also note that the limited number of observations affects the value and sign of the coefficients, as the information available for each defendant in the data set varies for each category, and could potentially skew our results. Furthermore, due to biases in data collection, we chose against cross validating our model as splitting the data could result in skewed proportions of defendants with certain characteristics.

    "The two regression models produced R² values of 0.11927 and 0.11911, respectively. These are relatively low values, indicating that our model isn't entirely effective. Because of the volatility of our dataset, it makes sense that relationships between variables could not be fully captured by this model, hence, resulting in low R² values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, examining the relationship between prison time and race in the dataset in Figure 1, we can see that White defendants tend to have an increase of only 1 month in total prison time, compared to that of Black defendants, Asian/Pacific Islander defendants,  or defendants of other races who have increases of 7, 13, and 25 months in prison time, respectively. This may indicate biases in the data as we can see clear differences in the coefficients (and thus prison times) for different races. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see the coefficient for American Indian or Alaskan Native defendants is very low with a value of about -31, meaning defendants of this race tend to have about 31 months less of prison time, which is particularly surprising due to the fact that defendants of this race had the highest average prison time, according to the earlier bar graph of average total prison time by race. This points to errors within our ML methods, which may be attributed to American Indian or Alaskan Native defendants with high prison times, which would skew prison time averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 shows the coefficient values for citizenship status. It is evident that those labeled as extradited aliens are likely to have a higher prison sentencing, indicated by the positive coefficient value. The other variables, such as United States citizen, resident, illegal alien, and not a US citizen are negatively correlated with total prison time, meaning that being in one of those categories would generally indicate a lower prison time. Although our model may be skewed, it is generally intuitive that those labeled as extradited aliens are likely to face a higher prison sentencing in comparison to those who are US citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Figure 3, the coefficient with the greatest magnitude was for the group where information on Hispanic origin was not available. Therefore, our results for this category were generally inconclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, looking at the relationship between the type of criminal offense and prison time in Figure 4, it is evident that the two highest bars belong to more serious offenses, including murder and kidnapping. This makes sense in terms of our dataset, as it acknowledges the relationship between crime severity and prison time. Additionally, because of the vast difference in prison time between serious offenses and other offenses, it is difficult to note significant differences between the coefficients for other offenses. These severe crimes may, thus, serve as outliers and skew the data as well."

    "Overall, our model definitely carried errors in terms of outliers and skewed coefficients, but from what we examined, we noted that defendants of certain races corresponded to higher prison times, on average, indicating possible biases. We also saw that type of crime is a large factor in deciding prison time, as one would expect. In summation, the most salient ethical implication of our project was the presence of possible racial bias in federal criminal sentencing. Additionally, due to the biased nature of our dataset, the results derived from our project should not be used for any kind of prediction and should only be used to highlight biases in the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further work on this topic could include developing a random forest classifier and examining the resulting feature importance graph, or analyzing datasets with more independent variables that could affect a defendant’s prison time. If biases are continued to be shown in future data analysis research, policies to relieve marginalized groups from longer prison sentences should be implemented at multiple levels including data collection methods, revising sentencing guidelines, and training and educating court personnel."
