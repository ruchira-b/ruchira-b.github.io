    <p>I am a sophomore at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Economics. I am 19 years old, grew up in Princeton, New Jersey, and have one younger brother.
      On campus, I am on the executive board of NU Rangila, an all-girl's Bollywood dance team and am a Senior Consultant for Northeastern Global Research and Consulting.
      In my free time, I enjoy upcycling, reading, dancing, and exploring Boston.
